# EasyBorrowedToolManager

My friends have a habit of borrowing tools from me all the time. Over time, you often lose track of who you've lent what to. To solve this problem I wrote a small Python script that gives me an overview of my lent tools. The script is very rudimentary and just cobbled together on the fly. So feel free to extend the project if needed.
